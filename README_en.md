## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Backend | FastAPI + SQLite (SQLModel) |
| Frontend | React + TypeScript + Vite |
| HTTP | curl_cffi |
| Browser Automation | Playwright / Camoufox |

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 18+
- Conda (recommended)
- Windows (recommended for using the included startup scripts directly)

## ChatGPT Specific Features

In the current version, **ChatGPT is one of the most feature-complete platforms**, supporting not only registration but also Token lifecycle management, status probing, and external system synchronization.

### 1. ChatGPT Token Mode Switching

The current version provides two ChatGPT registration modes:

- **With RT** (recommended by default)
  - Uses the new PR pipeline
  - Outputs **Access Token + Refresh Token**
- **Without RT** (legacy compatibility)
  - Uses the old pipeline
  - Only outputs **Access Token / Session**
  - Features depending on RT may not work

This toggle can be found in:

- Registration task page
- ChatGPT platform registration popup

### 4. ChatGPT Batch Status Sync & Re-upload

At the top of the ChatGPT platform list, there are two types of batch capabilities:

- **Status Sync**
  - Sync selected accounts' local status
  - Sync selected accounts' CLIProxyAPI status
  - Or batch execute on current filter results
- **Re-upload accounts not found on remote**
  - Re-upload auth-files not found on the remote
  - Supports "current filter scope" or "currently selected accounts"

## Email Service Support

Based on the actual configuration in the registration page, the project supports the following email services:

| Service Name | Identifier | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LuckMail | `luckmail` | Free to claim for testing, **daily check-in to continue receiving emails** |
| MoeMail | `moemail` | Default common solution, auto-registers accounts and generates emails |
| TempMail.lol | `tempmail_lol` | Temporary email, some regions may require a proxy |
| SkyMail (CloudMail) | `skymail` | Used via API / Token / Domain |
| YYDS Mail / MaliAPI | `maliapi` | Supports domain and automatic domain strategy |
| GPTMail | `gptmail` | Generates temporary emails via GPTMail API with rotation, supports random address assembly when domains are known |
| DuckMail | `duckmail` | Temporary email solution |
| Freemail | `freemail` | Self-hosted email service |
| Laoudo | `laoudo` | Fixed email solution |
| CF Worker | `cfworker` | Self-hosted email via Cloudflare Worker |

### Kiro Email Notes

Kiro currently has strict risk control, and the email solution significantly affects success rate. The project also retains this important note:

- **Self-hosted email: 100% success rate**
- **Built-in temporary email: 0% success rate**

Therefore, when registering **Kiro (AWS Builder ID)**, it is recommended to prioritize using a **self-hosted email**.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install uv (Recommended Python Package Manager)

If not installed yet, see the [official uv install guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/):

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

### 2. Sync Backend Dependencies

`uv sync` reads `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`, installs Python 3.12 automatically and creates `.venv/`:

```bash
uv sync
```

> The repo still ships `requirements.txt` (auto-generated by `uv export`) for compatibility with the legacy `pip install -r requirements.txt` flow, but **new users should use `uv sync`**.

### 3. Install Browser Dependencies

```bash
uv run playwright install chromium
uv run camoufox fetch
```

### 4. Install and Build Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

After building, static assets are output to:

```text
./static
```

### 5. Start the Project

#### Recommended for Windows

PowerShell:

```powershell
.\start_backend.ps1
```

CMD:

```bat
start_backend.bat
```

#### Manual Start

```bash
uv run python main.py
```

After starting, access at:

```text
http://localhost:8000
```

> If you've already run `npm run build`, the frontend is served by FastAPI directly, so you access `8000`, not `5173`.

## Windows Startup Scripts

The repo includes the following scripts:

- `start_backend.bat`
- `start_backend.ps1`
- `stop_backend.bat`
- `stop_backend.ps1`

These scripts run `uv sync` to ensure dependencies are up to date before starting/stopping the backend, avoiding common issues:

- Backend starts but Solver doesn't launch
- `ModuleNotFoundError: quart`
- Turnstile Solver on frontend always shows "Not Running"

To stop services, run:

PowerShell:

```powershell
.\stop_backend.ps1
```

CMD:

```bat
stop_backend.bat
```

By default, this stops:

- Backend port: `8000`
- Solver port: `8889`

## Frontend Development Mode

Suitable for debugging React pages.

### Terminal 1: Start Backend

```powershell
.\start_backend.ps1
```

### Terminal 2: Start Vite

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Access at:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

Vite proxies `/api` requests to the backend at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Turnstile Solver

### Auto Start

The local Turnstile Solver is automatically launched when the FastAPI backend starts, defaulting to:

```text
http://localhost:8889
```

The frontend "Global Config → Captcha → Turnstile Solver" shows the **detection result from the backend**, therefore:

- Backend not started → Frontend shows "Not Running"
- Backend started but wrong conda environment → Solver may fail to start

### Manual Solver Start

```bash
conda activate any-auto-register
python services/turnstile_solver/start.py --browser_type camoufox --port 8889
```

### Solver Logs

If startup fails, check:

```text
services/turnstile_solver/solver.log
```

## Docker Deployment

The repo root includes:

- `Dockerfile`
- `docker-compose.yml`

Default deployment includes:

- FastAPI Backend
- Built frontend static assets
- SQLite database persistence at `./data`
- Local Turnstile Solver auto-launched with the backend

### Start

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

The first build will additionally download Python dependencies, Playwright Chromium, and Camoufox, so it will take noticeably longer.

The current Dockerfile now installs Camoufox via direct links to avoid GitHub Releases API anonymous rate limiting.

### Access

```text
http://localhost:8000
```

### Stop

```bash
docker compose down
```

### View Logs

```bash
docker compose logs -f app
```

### Data Persistence

The container defaults to:

```text
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////app/data/account_manager.db
```

The host machine mounts to:

```text
./data
```

### Common Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | FastAPI listen address |
| `PORT` | `8000` | FastAPI listen port |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite:////app/data/account_manager.db` | SQLite database path |
| `APP_ENABLE_SOLVER` | `1` | Whether to auto-start Solver, set to `0` to disable |
| `SOLVER_PORT` | `8889` | Solver listen port |
| `LOCAL_SOLVER_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8889` | Backend access URL for Solver |

To change settings like `SMSTOME_COOKIE`, `OPENAI_*`, simply write them to the `.env` file in the repo root, and `docker compose` will automatically inject them into the container environment.

### Camoufox Build Parameters

To override the upstream version, specify during build:

```bash
CAMOUFOX_VERSION=135.0.1 CAMOUFOX_RELEASE=beta.24 docker compose build app
```

### Docker Usage Notes

- The current Docker image primarily covers the main application and local Turnstile Solver
- Auto-install/launch logic for `grok2api`, `CLIProxyAPI`, `Kiro Account Manager` still favors the host machine environment
- If you depend on `conda`, Go, or Windows executables, it is not recommended to run these directly in the current Linux container
- If you only need Web UI, account management, task scheduling, and local Solver, the current Compose configuration works out of the box

## Plugins & External Dependencies

### Temporary Email Source

The project supports self-hosting temporary email via Cloudflare Worker, sourced from:

- <https://github.com/dreamhunter2333/cloudflare_temp_email>

### External Plugin Git URLs

The project currently supports on-demand installation/launch of the following external components:

| Project | Purpose | Git URL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CLIProxyAPI | CPA / Proxy pool management service | `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI.git` |
| grok2api | Grok token management, backfill, chat/API service | `https://github.com/chenyme/grok2api.git` |
| kiro-account-manager | Kiro account management plugin | `https://github.com/hj01857655/kiro-account-manager.git` |

The **"Install Latest / Update to Latest"** button in the plugin page syncs the latest code from the repo, and now supports **uninstallation** (stops the service first, then deletes the local plugin directory).
By default, it updates to the **latest semver tag**; you can also switch back to **branch HEAD** mode in "Settings → Plugins → Install/Update Strategy".

If you need to change to `ghproxy`, `gitclone`, enterprise Git mirrors, or other proxy addresses, you'll need to also modify:

```text
services/external_apps.py
```

## Common Troubleshooting

### 1. Turnstile Solver Shows "Not Running" on Frontend

First check if the backend is running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/solver/status
```

Normal response:

```json
{"running":true}
```

If port `8000` is unreachable, the issue is with the backend, not the Solver.

### 2. `ModuleNotFoundError: quart`

The Python used to start the backend is not the `any-auto-register` environment. Use:

```powershell
.\start_backend.ps1
```

or:

```bat
start_backend.bat
```

### 3. Verify the Correct Python

```bash
python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"
```

Expected output:

```text
D:\miniconda\conda3\envs\any-auto-register\python.exe
```

### 4. Solver Opens but Status is Still Abnormal

Check both addresses:

```text
http://localhost:8000/api/solver/status
http://localhost:8889/
```

If the second one works but the first doesn't, the issue is with the backend, not the Solver.

### 5. Port Already in Use

If you get `WinError 10048` on startup, first run:

```powershell
.\stop_backend.ps1
```

Then restart:

```powershell
.\start_backend.ps1
```

## Electron Development Notes

Electron development mode does NOT auto-start the Python backend.

You must first start the backend from the project root:

```powershell
.\start_backend.ps1
```

Then run Electron.
